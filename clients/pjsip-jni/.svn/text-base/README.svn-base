This project implements a Java Native Interface wrapper for the pjsua (pjsip) library.
It exposes the pjsua (sip user interface) API to Java programs and is built using swig
(Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator, swig.org). The wrapper is mostly complete,
with a few exceptions. One problem so far is that passing void* pointer up to Java is
a bit difficult with swig. Therefore a few callback functions do not expose all the
available data. The exposed API is sufficient to build a working phone, though.

This package contains prebuilt binaries for the wrapper. You simply have to import the
directory as a project into eclipse and can use it as either a plugin based project or
a Java project.

If you want to compile the wrapper yourself, you need a Linux installation and you have
to install the pjsip library on it. Please see the Makefile for detailed instructions
about how to build the Windows and Linux wrappers.
